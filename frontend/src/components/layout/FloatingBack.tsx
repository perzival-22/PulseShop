/**
 * Mobile-only floating back control, rendered on every buyer route by
 * MobileShell. Sits above the bottom nav pill / product action bar, in the
 * bottom-left corner where a thumb actually reaches — the header back arrows it
 * replaces were at the top of the screen, the hardest place to hit one-handed.
 *
 * navigate(-1) alone would not do. Most shoppers arrive on a deep link shared
 * from WhatsApp or Instagram, so on a cold load there is no in-app history
 * entry behind them and "back" would bounce them out of PulseShop entirely.
 * React Router tracks its own position in the history stack as `idx`, so use
 * that to tell a real in-app back from a first page view, and fall back to the
 * shop they're browsing.
