        <p>
          PulseShop began with a simple observation: e-commerce was booming everywhere, yet
          the local shops we knew, the sellers posting products to their status every
          morning, taking orders in their DMs, were being left out of it. The tools built
          for online selling assumed a warehouse, a card machine and a marketing team.
          Their customers, meanwhile, were already shopping on WhatsApp, Instagram and
          Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by that wave of trending e-commerce, founder{" "}
          <strong className="font-bold text-ink">Raynald Gitau</strong> and co-founder{" "}
          <strong className="font-bold text-ink">Wilch Kelvin</strong> set out to close the
          gap, to give every local shop a real storefront that lives right behind the
          social posts they already make, so evolving into the new generation of online
          shopping takes minutes, not months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today that idea is PulseShop: a link you drop in your bio that opens into a full
          catalogue, takes orders straight to your chats, and grows with your shop, from
          the first five products to a storefront that shows up in search results.
